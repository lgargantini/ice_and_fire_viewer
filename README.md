# An Interface of Ice and Fire

"As an avid fan of the epic series A Song of Ice and Fire, I have a hard time keeping up with all of the characters who lose their heads. As such, I would like to have an application that can help me track which characters from the series are alive or dead." 


* Uses https://anapioficeandfire.com/ as a data source
* Is built using your tech stack of choice
    - Note: the customer is looking for people with Next.js experience, especially using the App Router, but you are free to use any technology youâ€™d like.
* The Houses resource from the API (https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses) is paginated by default to 10 results, for these 10 houses please display a list of all of their Sworn Members grouped by house
* For each Sworn Member display their full name and whether they are alive or dead
* If a character is dead, please display the information provided by the API about their death
* If a house has no Sworn Members, please display the message "This house has no sworn members"
* You are welcome to use tools like ChatGPT if that is a part of your daily workflow but please be prepared to defend your choice to use those tools and provide alternate methods if requested on review
* You may have other ideas of how you could elaborate this project.  If you have time available you are welcome to add those as well, but realize that any bugs in additional features may count against you as much as the added features count for you.  You should focus on quality more than quantity.

#### Note: Submissions will be accepted in the form of GitHub link, CodeSandbox link or zip file. Please provide instructions for how to run the application. Please also include a 5 minute video documenting your submission.
